Feature: Email Substitute Shifts
  As a student
  I want to be able to post substitutions for my shifts
  so that any student can view and claim the shifts I canâ€™t make.

Background: A work entry has been added to my calendar

  Given the following users exist:
    | name         | user_type      | initials  | cas_user |

  Scenario: Put my shift up for substitution
    Given I am on the "Post a Substitution" page
    When I select the entry with description "Work at Wheeler" for substitution
    And I fill in "Description" with "Urgent - fix printer"
    And I press "Make Substitution"
    Then I should recieve an email
    
  Scenario: Take a substitution shift
    Given I am on the "View Substitutions" page
    When I check the substitution "Work at Moffit"
    And I check the substitution "Presentation"
    And I press "Take Selected Substitutions"
    Then I should recieve an email
